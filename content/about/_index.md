I am a 20 something year old Hacker and Systems Engineer. I have a big passion for playing with tech stuffs and general science. Be that the ones you would expect such as physics and chemistry but also psychology and sociology. I am dabbling in management and entrepeneurship at the moment and generaly enjoy it. 

So whatever I find worth sharing to the world you will find in this blog. Happy reading.
